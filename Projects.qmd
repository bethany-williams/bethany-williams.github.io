I am broadly interested in how organisms use physiological and behavioral mechanisms to cope with environmental stressors like hypoxia, turbidity, and warming temperatures.â€‹ I use a combination of field and laboratory techniques to address these questions.

**Adaptation in Sulfide Springs**

Research during my NSF postdoctoral research fellowship in biology will focus on understanding how interactions between the environment, genotype, and phenotype shape co-tolerance of hypoxia and hydrogen sulfide tolerance in *Poecilia mexicana*.

**African Swamps**

My PhD research has focused specifically on understanding how the combination of hypoxia and turbidity affect the reproductive physiology and behavior of an African cichlid (*Pseudocrenilabrus multicolor*) found in swamps and rivers throughout the Nile river basin.

**Frozen Frogs**

My Master's research on wood frogs (*Rana sylvatica*) focused on understanding the physiology of freeze tolerance
