I am broadly interested in how organisms use physiological and behavioral mechanisms to cope with environmental stressors like hypoxia, turbidity, and warming temperatures.â€‹ I use a combination of field and laboratory techniques to address these questions.

Research during my NSF postdoctoral research fellowship in biology will focus on understanding how interactions between the environment, genotype, and phenotype shape co-tolerance of hypoxia and hydrogen sulfide tolerance in *Poecilia mexicana*.

My PhD research has focused specifically on understanding how the combination of hypoxia and turbidity affect the reproductive physiology and behavior of an African cichlid (*Pseudocrenilabrus multicolor*).

My Master's research on wood frogs (*Rana sylvatica*) focused on understanding the physiology of freeze tolerance
